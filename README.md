# Coursera getdata-015 course project repository

##The purpose and the goal
This repository is a result of coursera getdata-015 course project. The purpose of this project was
 to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The goal was to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

##The repository contains

1. A main tidy data set as described below
2. An additional tidy data set as described below
3. `run_analysis.R` script which performs necessary transformation of raw data necessary to get tidy data sets
4. A code book called CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations and work that is neccessary to clean up the data. 
5. This README.md file with explanations of how all of the scripts work and how they are connected  
6. `getrawdata.R` script which contains code to obtain and unpack initial raw data

##About the area
The course project is about one of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now - wearable computing. 
[Recomended article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/)

 Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop 
the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data
 linked to from the course website represent data collected 
from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description is available at the [site where the data was obtained](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

##Initial data

##Actual tasks of the course project
Create one R script called `run_analysis.R` that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
